<div align="justify">
I have been lucky to be part of several brainstorming sessions over
several years. And I was fortunate to lead some of these sessions also.
I would like to share some of those key ideas to make you successful in
a brainstorming session.
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>How to start and proceed?</strong></p>

<p>
<div align="justify">
Initial conversations in a brainstorming session are usually in the
category of fact-finding. Members share what they know about the
subject. Or what is the problem at hand? At this point, we should be
patient and listen to each other. It is a great idea to take notes to
capture the viewpoints of the problems at hand.
</div>
</p>
<p>
<div align="justify">
Once you grasp a bird view of the problem at hand, you can move to an
interrogative session to attain better clarity. This will help you to
correct yourself and identify some hidden aspects of the discussion
points. Another benefit of an interrogative session is that that leads
to differentiate the perspective and facts in place. This is my favorite
part of a brainstorming session. One recommendation is to replace
\'why\' questions with \'what\' and \'how\' questions. The \'why
question\' is usually considered as defending and may create adverse
impact and create friction. Another good option is in hand to use
\'yes/no\' questions.
</div>
</p>
<p>
<div align="justify">
Attained enough clarity, we can move to the idea-sharing step. All team
members should allow putting forward their small ideas as well as big
ones without any judgment. Building an atmosphere of welcoming all kinds
of opinions is a foundation block for a brainstorming session. It is an
appropriate approach to use a whiteboard to list all of the ideas one by
one and create a merit table. While paraphrasing and writing into the
merit table, team members can indulge in the clarification process.
</div>
</p>
<p>
<div align="justify">
In the next step, team members can debate each idea. We can add pros and
cons columns in the merit table along with a weightage. Adding a
weightage column is very important. There is a human tendency to count
the number of pros and cons and reaching a decision. By adding the
weightage, we can escape from the delusion of counts.
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Role of a leader</strong></p>

<p>
<div align="justify">
What is the role of a leader in a brainstorming session? Clarifying the
problems and setting the boundaries of discussion are the contributions
expecting from the leader. On top of this, a leader can ask questions if
a brainstorming session is stuck with ways to proceed. That will help
other team members can redirect and channelize their thoughts.
</div>
</p>
<p>
<div align="justify">
If a discussion is not moving in the proper direction and end up in a
time-consuming process, one possible reason for that is the complexity
of the problem at hand. In that scenario, the intuitive thought process
may not guide us to the lead. A deductive approach is the best tool at
that moment.
</div>
</p>
<p>
<div align="justify">
While practicing the deductive approach presents the problem as in its
simplest form. This helps us to comes up with quite an obvious solution.
From there, we can add attributes to the problem and evolve the solution
further. Initially, it looks like a time-consuming approach, but in
reality, it is another way.
