I"v<p><strong>Memories……</strong></p>

<p>I was born and brought up in a small beautiful village
called Krishnankotta, Kerala, India surrounded by backwater. 
We used to cross a river and walk miles every day to school. 
Some days high waves in the river wet our shorts on the 
way, heavy rain shatters our umbrella. During summer days, 
we played cricket and soccer.</p>
