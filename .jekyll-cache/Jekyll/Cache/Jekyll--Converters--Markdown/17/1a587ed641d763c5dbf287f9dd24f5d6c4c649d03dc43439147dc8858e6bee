<p>Relational databases follow the ACID Guarantee. ACID stands for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Atomicity: A transaction considers as a single unit irrespective of actions within a transaction.</li>
  <li>Consistency: Transaction changes database from a valid state to another.</li>
  <li>Isolation: The impact of concurrent transactions would be the same as they execute sequentially.</li>
  <li>Durability: Committed transactions saved in permanent storage.</li>
</ul>
